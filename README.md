**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Pupper stands for "PHP Plus React" (PPR -> Pupper). The goal is to make a Framework that takes the best of both technologies and makes them communicate bi-directionnaly.

It's inspired by the article [Game Development with React and PHP: How Compatible Are They?](https://www.sitepoint.com/game-development-with-reactjs-and-php-how-compatible-are-they/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTUdZek9URTFNR1JrTVRCaCIsInQiOiJxbnB6Z0JVNDBtdFRvSWFMMStkcmhuWGIrMkdDWlhwS1VSMGFGN1hwb0pxTUxcL1VBc015UmxEQ3J3VDBSSkFRNjh2ejVTdEluXC9QcEppT0VXQ3kybkxaMTZJSnExT1BJRjB3TFwvaTEyOWNCQkd4ZlZtcVlEK0hKSlFxKzE1WEhPTCJ9) by Christopher Pitt.
